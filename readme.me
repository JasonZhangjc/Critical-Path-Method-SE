Critical Path Method (CPM) is an algorithm for planning, managing and analyzing the timing of a project.  
The step-by-step CPM system helps to identify critical and non-critical tasks from projects' start to completion and prevents temporary risks.  
Here is a script in python to calculate Critical Path for activity and calculate ES,LS,EF,LF for Slack calculation.
